This directory contains wet sound files recorded in different spaces with a cellphone.

The purpose of these files is to record the real reverb generated in these spaces (as opposed to the simulated convolution reverb). These files can then be tested to see if the reverb_analysis is able to identify the reverb space successfully. These files were recorded with a cellphone, as we anticipate that's the equipment users have. For this reason these are not high quality recordings and have significant signal noise in them.
